Wow! this feel sureal. Chanda here learning to catch up with the new way of doing things, now that its clear i have been left far behind. I summon the willpower to get me through the thoughts flooding my mind leading me to think im not up to the challenge this is clearly posing.
As some guy i knew used to say "I am the bone of my sword... unkown to death nor known to life...i have withstood pain to creat many weapons, yet these hands can not hold anything... So, as i pray, Unlimited Blade Works!"
