Wow! this feels sureal. Chanda here learning to catch up with the new way of doing things, now that its clear i have been left far behind. I summon the willpower within to get me through the thoughts flooding my mind leading me to think im not up to the challenge this is clearly posing.
As some guy i knew used to say "I am the bone of my sword... unknown to death, nor known to life...i have withstood pain to create many weapons, yet these hands will never hold anything... So, as i pray, Unlimited Blade Works!"
